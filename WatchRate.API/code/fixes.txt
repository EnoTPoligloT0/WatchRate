Your database schema closely aligns with the domain model for the MovieRate platform, but there are a few differences and potential improvements to ensure full compatibility:

1. Compatibility Overview
âœ… Movies Table: Mostly matches the domain model, but lacks an explicit ReleaseDate column. The MaturityRating column is a VARCHAR(10) instead of an ENUM, which could be fine depending on your database engine.
âœ… Persons Table: Matches well with the Person aggregate but is named Person instead of Persons.
âœ… Users Table: Matches the User aggregate well.
âœ… MovieCast & MovieCrew: Aligns well with the cast and crew sections in the domain model.
âœ… MovieGenres: Exists and links movies with genres, but genres themselves are embedded in the domain model JSON rather than explicitly stored in a separate Genres table.
âœ… StreamingPlatforms: Matches the streamingUrls in the domain model.
âœ… UserRatings: Exists and captures value, review, and timestamps, but lacks an explicit uniqueness constraint for (UserId, MovieId).
âœ… UserWatchlist & UserFavorites: Exist and capture the necessary relationships.

2. Differences and Suggested Fixes
Feature	Difference	Suggested Fix
MaturityRating	Stored as VARCHAR(10)	Change to an ENUM for consistency and data integrity.
MovieGenres	No explicit Genres table	Add a Genres table with a UUID primary key.
UserRatings	No UNIQUE(UserId, MovieId) constraint	Add a UNIQUE constraint to prevent duplicate ratings.
Person Table Naming	Named Person instead of Persons	Change to Persons for consistency with other tables.
Movie Aggregate Missing ReleaseDate	No ReleaseDate column in Movies	Add a ReleaseDate DATE column.
3. Conclusion
Your database schema is very close to the domain model and should work well with some minor tweaks. The most important changes are adding a Genres table, enforcing rating uniqueness, and considering an ENUM for MaturityRating.

Would you like help with the SQL to implement these fixes? ðŸš€




The main differences and required changes are:

Person/Persons table structure:

Needs to be renamed from "Person" to "Persons"
Name structure needs to change from FirstName/LastName to single Name field
Birth date needs to be converted to proper DATE type
Some NOT NULL constraints need to be removed to match domain model


Enums and Types:

Need to add maturity_rating enum type for proper validation
Need to modify the MaturityRating column in Movies table


Constraints and Relations:

Need to add UNIQUE constraints for user-movie relationships
Need to add value check constraint for ratings (1-10)
Need to create proper Genres table and modify MovieGenres structure


Other Adjustments:

MovieCast needs NOT NULL constraints and proper integer type for Order
MovieCrew needs NOT NULL constraint for Department
StreamingPlatforms needs column rename from Name to Platform



The provided SQL modifications will align your current schema with the domain model. Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or help with implementing these changes?
